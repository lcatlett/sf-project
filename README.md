This is a Composer-based installer for an Acquia Cloud Site Factory BLT project with an ACSF base Drupal distribution.

## Get Started
```
$ git clone git@github.com:lcatlett/sf-platform.git && cd sf-platform && composer install
```
Composer will create a project containing a `docroot` directory with a full Lightning and BLT code base therein.
