This is a Composer-based installer for an Acquia Cloud Site Factory BLT project with an ACSF base Drupal distribution.

## Get Started
```
$ git clone git@github.com:lcatlett/sf-platform.git MY_PROJECT && cd MY_PROJECT && composer install
```
Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT containing a `docroot` directory with a full Lightning and BLT code base therein.
